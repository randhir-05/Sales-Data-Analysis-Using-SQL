# Project Overview

This project analyzes a sales dataset using SQL to extract meaningful insights into sales performance, customer segmentation, profitability, shipping efficiency, time-based trends, geographical performance, and order management efficiency.

# Dataset Information
    The dataset contains transactional sales data, including:
    
    order_id: Unique identifier for each order.
    
    order_date: Date of order placement.
    
    order_priority: Priority level of each order (e.g., High, Low, Critical).
    
    order_quantity: Number of products ordered.
    
    sales: Total sales amount.
    
    unit_price: Price per unit of product.
    
    ship_mode: Shipping method (e.g., Regular Air, Express Air).
    
    shipping_cost: Cost incurred for shipping.
    
    province: Customer location.
    
    customer_segment: Type of customer (e.g., Small Business, Home Office).

    product_category: Category of the product sold (e.g., Office Supplies, Technology).
    
    product_sub_category: More detailed category of the product.
    
    product_container: Packaging used for the product.
    
    ship_date: Date when the order was shipped.

# Key Analysis Areas


Sales Performance: Analyzing total sales, average order values, and sales growth over time.

Customer Segmentation: Examining different customer types and their impact on sales, especially in terms of profitability.

Profitability: Evaluating revenue in relation to costs such as shipping to determine overall profitability.

Shipping & Delivery Efficiency: Investigating the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of different shipping methods.

Time-Based Analysis: Looking at sales trends across different time periods (yearly, monthly, etc.).

Geographical Analysis: Identifying which provinces generate the highest sales.

Order Management & Efficiency: Analyzing order priority levels, shipping times, and delivery efficiency.

# SQL Queries

The SQL script includes queries that:

Aggregate sales data for overall performance analysis.

Segment customers based on sales, profit, and location.

Compare shipping methods to identify the most cost-efficient options.

Perform time-based analysis to track sales trends over time.

Analyze the profitability by combining sales data with shipping costs.

Generate reports on geographical performance by province.


# Tools Used

SQL: Structured Query Language for querying and managing the dataset.
